Creating a Model using Freezed

An example is better than a long abstract explanation, so here's a typical Freezed class:
```dart
// This file is "main.dart"
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

// required: associates our `main.dart` with the code generated by Freezed
part 'main.freezed.dart';
// optional: Since our Person class is serializable, we must add this line.
// But if Person was not serializable, we could skip it.
part 'main.g.dart';

@freezed
class Person with _$Person {
const factory Person({
required String firstName,
required String lastName,
required int age,
}) = _Person;

factory Person.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json)
=> _$PersonFromJson(json);
}
```
